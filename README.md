- I'm currently working on a websocket server to allow lua-enabled GBA emulators to communicate with an Angular website live, and a set of scripts utilizing it that allows sharing items between Super Metroid and Metroid: Zero Mission. I also just finished a new iteration of my Wordle solver ([check it out here!](https://judstewart.github.io/Wordle-Solver-2/!)) and was previously working on [an Angular project for a friend of mine](https://judstewart.github.io/Aurinn-Train/origins).
